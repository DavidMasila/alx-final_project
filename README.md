## Scorprog Liqour Store  

This is my final WebStack Portfolio project for the ALX project

## Project Details 

The project simulates an online liqour store where the buyer is able to:

* Create an Account  
* Log in
* Access Protected Pages that require log in  
* Contact representatives by use of zoho sales IQ

The shop owner is also able to access a protected route that enables them to add products

The project is majorly Backend Oriented with focus on:  

* Creating Models with SQLALchemy and Postgresql
* Adding Users to Databases
* Performing CRUD on the Databases to display on pages
* Creating View Routes  
* Creating Blueprints with flask
* Authenticating and Authorizing users
* Protecting Pages
* Paginating pages

## Improvements Needed

* Creating description pages for the products
* Adding Javascript Code to handle an add cart functionality
* Add Stripe Api/MPESA Api fot payments and checking out
* Overally Better UI

## Acknowledgements

* Me (lol)
* The Great Team at ALX for the sponsorship and Training
